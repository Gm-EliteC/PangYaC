What is Working:,
-Calculating
-Support For Multiple Resolutions (3840x2160, 2560x1440, 2048x1152, 1920x1080, 1600x900) both screen mode and maximized. 
           •Do not maximize low resolution game into a big monitor, just don't. 
-For best results use 1280x960, 2560x1140, 3840x2160 due to Spin. If you use other resolutions manually adjust the spin (because the app cannot locate a pixel in the decimal location). 
-Spin and Curve Cursor, Supports dragging the Screen
-AIM Assist, Supports Dragging the Screen (see supported resolutions).
-Move UI elements freely. 
-Calculate with any spin
-Wind Angle reading for ANY resolution. Just adjust it using the buttons (Up, Down, Left, Right, +, -)  and click "Save SS" (this will be saved to your computer app folder). 
              •If left or right arrows are not moving, try clicking many times to left until it gets set up correctly, Save SS. 
-Configuration File closing, opening, installing. Now you can simply download, install it or run it from PangYaC.exe
-Course Button (auto fills Height, Distance, Slope) BL, Ice Cannon, Ice Spa, Pink Wind, Lost Seaway only, will keep adding more. Now with colors and remembers course. 
-4k! strangely enough and due to the nature of the pixels Spin and Curve values are not prefect in odd numbers. So do 2, 4, 6,  etc. 
-For non supported resolutions, you can now view a log saved in the folder where you save and see more details so we can resolve. 
-Improved screen resolution reading and game capture so it accounts for Windows 10, 11 and the different borders. 
-Stay on Top, when taking screenshot, simply click stay on top to capture F11 in the app, not the game. Then un check to view wind angle reading. 
-NEW All courses have been added under "select course"
-NEW Optimal Spin. Now you can check this and the program will try to find the best caliper and spin within 0.1y (so if is short 0.1 it can still work).

-Life Quality updates 
-NEW minor bugs with overlay and added few missing slopes

What Is Not Working Properly,
-Some resolutions have issues and add a little curve, so try manual spin or other methods. Again, try 1280x960, 2560x1140 or 4K. 

What is Not Implemented,
-Slope Reading
